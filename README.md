# AstroScripts

Evans astro scripts that he is prepared to share.

A collection of simple (and not so simple) scripts that have been developed to solve problems.

## fix_fits

This script is for (currently) dropping the degenerate axes from fits files, and to add beam information, plans are afoot to add additional features

## specindy.py

This is my spectral index calculator, it matches a set of images then does the spectral index. Requires a working miriad install

## fz_convert

This is my attempt at a script to do this when you dont have cfitsio installed.
